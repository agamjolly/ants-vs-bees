# Ants versus Bees
A strategy-based tower defense game designed in Python with Tkinter, inspired by PopCap's Plants versus Zombies. 

## Explanation
As the ant queen, you populate your colony with the bravest ants you can muster. Your ants must protect their queen from the evil bees that invade your territory. Irritate the bees enough by throwing leaves at them, and they will be vanquished. Fail to pester the airborne intruders adequately, and your queen will succumb to the bees' wrath.<sup>[[1]](https://cs61a.org/proj/ants/)

## How to Run
Make sure that you have Tkinter installed. Running the package will throw an error if Tkinter is not installed, since Tkinter is one of the core modules used in the main `ants.py` file.

To run the CLI version of the game, `cd` into the directory and run 

```bash 
python3 ants_text.py
```

To run the GUI version of the game with Tkinter, use 

```bash 
python3 ants_gui.py
```
